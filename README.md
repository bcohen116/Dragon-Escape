# Dragon-Escape
A StarCraft II Arcade map/mod created for the 2015 Rock the Cabinet contest from Blizzard Entertainment.
**Map will be uploaded once the official contest is over and I am allowed to update the map.**


## What are StarCraft II Arcade maps/mods?
The StarCraft II Arcade is a community driven and made zone for games and mods made in the StarCraft II Editor. The editor is extremely powerful, and there are games in pretty much every category you can think of made completely from this editor.

## What is the StarCraft II Editor?
This editor is required to be able to make games and mods for the Arcade. There are multiple pieces of the editor. Pictures are included and you might need to scroll down a bit to see what is being talked about. The examples of the editor are like these: 
* The ground and land piece (you can find pictures [here](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/maps-and-mods/tutorials/terrain/1)).
* Data piece for holding art and variable attributes like speed of an object (pics [here](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/maps-and-mods/tutorials/data/1))
* Triggers, which are the main coding aspect. You can do this using pure script(usually done in something like notepad++), or with the dropdown based editor ([like this](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/maps-and-mods/tutorials/trigger/1)) both have the same capabilities.
* If you have access to a 3d model program, you can also create your own art assets through the StarCraft II art tools ([like this](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/10788362/starcraft-ii-art-tools-open-beta-8-30-2013))


The editor is written and writes code in what is known as **"Galaxy"**. This is a C-based laungage with humdreds if not thousands of custom functions built in. The Trigger editor mentioned above is what will be coding in this. While the drop down style will be easy to read, it has all of the programming concepts of other languages. Meanwhile, people who want to code using the script, will see what is similar to other programming styles of C with hard coding and typing it all out with little auto finishing capability. It is important to note that both styles of programming have the same capabilities and one is not worse than the other.

Map dependencies are also used in order to provide a wise range of art, music, and other premade assets which are shared to us from Blizzard and we are allowed to use it for the Arcade through their service agreement. This is optimal for people who are not skilled in high quality models and sound.

## Where can I start learning?
Personally, I am self taught. Seeing that there are not really classes about this, I recommend doing the same. There a multitude of tutorials around the internet (like [this](http://wiki.sc2mapster.com/Tutorials)) which will have everything you need to know to start making projects. I also have put out this project as open source for this reason.

Additionally, posting around forms like [sc2mapster](http://www.sc2mapster.com/forums/development/) will always help. The people there are always willing to help, even with the declining population of StarCraft II mappers.

## What can I do with this map?
Once I have uploaded the map, you'll have to have the StarCraft II Editor to be able to open it. If you have StarCraft II installed, you already have the editor, just open the Battle.net launcher and theres a green gear icon that says "editor". You can then take a look at my work, and even edit it if you please for your own learning. I only ask that you reference me (Fishy) somewhere in the map if you do decide to change it and publish it. Once the contest is over and I'm allowed to update the map, it will be "unlocked". This means you can also access this map through the editor directly. When you go to File -> Open, There is an option to check for online maps, give it a few minutes to load them all, and you can search for "Dragon Escape" by Fishy. However, it might be easier to save the file that will eventually be uploaded here to your maps folder where your editor files are stored (usually under the StarCraft II documents folder).

## Is this map finished?
Of course not! A map is never finished. Also considering the very limited time span I had to develop for this contest, there is still a ton to be worked on. For example, controls could be smoother, UI improved, abilities polished, new dragons created, new game modes, balancing. There are endless possibilities. Feel free to add some of these yourself.

## What went through my mind when I created Dragon Escape?
When the contest was announced, I knew I wanted to participate, as I love fiddling with programming in my free time. I had to think about a few things: 
* Who is my audience?
* What would be creative and new?
* How do my skills fit into the previous two?
After some thought, I came to the realization that there were not many racing games in the Arcade. Additionally, most people who play the Arcade are just looking for some fun in their free time, and a racing game fits this. I then thought, what would I need to know to be able to make this? I felt that there was a basic trigger and data knowledge needed to create this. After that I was set on creating this project!
